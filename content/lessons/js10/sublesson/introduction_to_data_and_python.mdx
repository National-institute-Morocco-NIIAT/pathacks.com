Topic wise overview of data science

## What Is Data Science?

This is a book about doing data science with Python, which immediately begs the question: what is data science? It's a surprisingly hard definition to nail down, especially given how ubiquitous the term has become. Vocal critics have variously dismissed it as a superfluous label (after all, what science doesn't involve data?) or a simple buzzword that only exists to salt resumes and catch the eye of overzealous tech recruiters.

In my mind, these critiques miss something important. Data science, despite its hype-laden veneer, is perhaps the best label we have for the cross-disciplinary set of skills that are becoming increasingly important in many applications across industry and academia. This cross-disciplinary piece is key: in my mind, the best existing definition of data science is illustrated by Drew Conway's Data Science Venn Diagram, first published on his blog in September 2010 (see the following figure).


## Who Is This Book For?
In my teaching both at the University of Washington and at various tech-focused conferences and meetups, one of the most common questions I have heard is this: "How should I learn Python?" The people asking are generally technically minded students, developers, or researchers, often with an already strong background in writing code and using computational and numerical tools. Most of these folks don't want to learn Python per se, but want to learn the language with the aim of using it as a tool for data-intensive and computational science. While a large patchwork of videos, blog posts, and tutorials for this audience is available online, I've long been frustrated by the lack of a single good answer to this question; that is what inspired this book.

The book is not meant to be an introduction to Python or to programming in general; I assume the reader has familiarity with the Python language, including defining functions, assigning variables, calling methods of objects, controlling the flow of a program, and other basic tasks. Instead, it is meant to help Python users learn to use Python's data science stack—libraries such as those mentioned in the following section, and related tools—to effectively store, manipulate, and gain insight from data.
